    <h1>Zhuoran Wang</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Zhuoran Wang, also known as Sophie. I'm studying Data Science and Probability & Statistics at the University of California, San Diego, aiming to graduate in 2026. My coursework covers Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Statistics, backed by a strong GPA and a scholarship from the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute.

        I excel in Python, R, and Java, and am proficient in various Machine Learning techniques. I'm actively involved in research, working on projects like neural network-based optical response studies and astrophysical time series simulations.
        
        As a tutor for UC San Diego's DSC 10 course, I guide students through complex data science concepts and techniques. This website showcases my academic achievements and projects, reflecting my journey and skills in data science. Welcome! </p>
